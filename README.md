# Brazilian Federal Government Budget and Payments Analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze Brazil's federal expenses data related to February 2021 and connect this information to the companies registration data and also the federal budget for the year. 

With this data, it is possible to understand:
- how the federal payments are distributed amoung the states
- which governmental departments use the majority of the federal resources
- what is the main comercial activity that receive most of the federal resources (i.e., which companies receive most payments and what those companies do)
